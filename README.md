Quantitative Sports Modelling | Predictive Systems Architecture | Applied Machine Learning

Independent quantitative modeller building fully automated end-to-end predictive systems for football markets.

Over 18 months designing, validating, and iterating structured machine learning pipelines focused on extracting edge from Asian Handicap markets.

Core Project
Soccer Asian Handicap Predictive System

Built a production-ready modelling framework in KNIME integrating:

Data Engineering

Large-scale historical match ingestion & preprocessing

Custom feature architecture (form indices, structured scorecards, momentum signals)

K-Means clustering for regime segmentation and edge isolation

Modelling Stack

Regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso, GLM)

Ensemble classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest)

H2O AutoML benchmarking & comparative validation

Cluster-specific model calibration

Validation & Performance

Strict out-of-sample validation

Regime-based performance segmentation

~60% directional accuracy in Asian Handicap markets

Strategy monitored with live P&L tracking and continuous recalibration

Technical Stack

KNIME (advanced workflow architecture & variable systems)

Machine Learning: regression, classification, clustering

Feature engineering for structured time-series sports data

Model evaluation & probabilistic calibration

Python (integrated workflows)

H2O AutoML experimentation

Modelling Philosophy

Edge over prediction

Structured validation over optimism

Regime awareness over global models

Continuous iteration driven by statistical evidence
