Independent quantitative modeller designing end-to-end predictive systems for football markets, focused on extracting edge from Asian Handicap betting.

Over 18 months, I’ve built regime-aware, automated predictive pipelines in KNIME, integrating structured feature engineering, clustering, and conditional model selection for robust out-of-sample performance.

Core Project
Soccer Asian Handicap Predictive System

System Overview:
A regime-aware predictive modelling framework integrating:

Feature Engineering & Data Encoding

Composite match-state feature encodings (structured performance indices)

Cluster-derived categorical features summarizing latent match regimes

Custom metrics capturing team form, momentum, and situational factors

Unsupervised & Supervised Modelling

K-Means clustering to segment matches into performance regimes

Ensemble classifiers: SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest

Regularized regression: Ridge, Lasso, GLM

Regime-conditional model selection (meta-learning / mixture-of-experts framework)

Validation & Performance

Strict out-of-sample testing

Regime-specific model calibration

Live P&L monitoring with continuous recalibration

Achieved ~60% directional accuracy in Asian Handicap markets

Technical Stack

KNIME: Advanced workflow design, variable management, and automation

Machine Learning: Regression, classification, clustering

Feature Engineering: Structured encodings, meta-features, regime signals

Model Selection: Conditional routing, ensemble gating, meta-learning

AutoML Integration: H2O (benchmarking & model comparison)

Modelling Philosophy

Prioritize edge over raw prediction

Build structured, regime-aware models rather than single global predictors

Validate rigorously with out-of-sample testing

Continuously iterate with data-driven recalibration and monitoring
